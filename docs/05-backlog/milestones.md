# Milestones

## Overview
V1 (MVP) is split into 9 milestones (M1–M9), ordered by dependency. V2 adds 4 milestones (M10–M13) covering POS / omnichannel and merchant-ready upgrades as two parallel tracks. See `backlog-v1.md` for detailed tasks within each milestone.

Note: M8 (Infra) work starts in parallel with M1 (Docker Compose, CI skeleton). The dependency arrow means "must be feature-complete before the next milestone's features are testable end-to-end."

## V2 Milestone Map

V2 runs two parallel tracks: **POS / Omnichannel** (M10B → M11–M13 POS packets) and **Merchant-Ready Core** (M10A → M11–M13 core packets). Both tracks converge in M13 for unified reporting.

```
M10A Auth/Onboarding ───────────┐
  (real auth, self-serve         │
   onboarding)                   │
                                 ├──▶ M11 Selling & Payments MVP ──▶ M12 Operations ──▶ M13 Reporting
                                 │      (POS sell screen, cash,        & Variants          & Polish
M10B POS Foundation ────────────┘       receipts, inventory,
  (cashier role, pos_sales               payment config,
   domain)                               customers table)
```

Note: M10A and M10B start with planning-only packets (M10A.1, M10B.1) before any implementation. Both planning packets can run in parallel. `customers` table ships in M11 and does not block POS MVP.
